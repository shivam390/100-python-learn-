Python is easy to write and need to bother about memory allocation as compared to other language.
Python provide cross OS support which means code can be used in other operating systems.
It is a interpreter based langauge means that the code is excuted line by line hence make it easy to debug also python is much slower then C++ and Java.

TOPICS
1) DATA TYPES
i) Integer ii) Float iii) String iv) Array v) Complex vi) Boolean vii) List viii) Tuple ix) Dictionary x) sets

Numbers
a=5 
b=10.3
c=5+3j
g="I'm a bad guy"
h=True
i=False
to know the data type of these variable above use command type(variable_name)
type(a) ---> int
type(b)---> float
type(c)---> complex
type(g)----> Str
type(h)----> bool
type(i)----> bool

LISTS
there is no limitation on data type a list can hold or store int,str or boolean and sets.
no forced type casting that happens.
Lists are mutable
