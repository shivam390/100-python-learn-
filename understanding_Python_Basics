TOPICS
1) DATA TYPES
i) Integer ii) Float iii) String iv) Array v) Complex vi) Boolean vii) List viii) Tuple ix) Dictionary x) sets

Numbers
a=5 
b=10.3
c=5+3j
g="I'm a bad guy"
h=True
i=False
to know the data type of these variable above use command type(variable_name)
type(a) ---> int
type(b)---> float
type(c)---> complex
type(g)----> Str
type(h)----> bool
type(i)----> bool

LISTS
there is no limitation on data type a list can hold or store int,str or boolean and sets.
no forced type casting that happens.
Lists are mutable
