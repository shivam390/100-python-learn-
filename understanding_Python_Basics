# Basic to know about python ####
(In order to work with python and if you are beginner then anacoda navigator is the best option use jupyter notebook)
Python is a open source language and Interpreter based language.
Python is easy to write and need to bother about memory allocation as compared to other language.
Python provide cross OS support which means code can be used in other operating systems.
It is a interpreter based langauge means that the code is excuted line by line hence make it easy to debug also python is much slower then C++ and Java.

In python comments are preceded by # or block of comments by """ write here """.

1)Program Hello World 

In python there is nothing much more then one print statement to print Hello World.

Here it is how print statement works.

print('Hello World') 

Just write the above command and this is all it need to take to print hello world in python.

Things to know in Python as basic part

1) how to know the present working directory (all commands will run in jupyter notebook in our case)
pwd

TOPICS
1) DATA TYPES
i) Integer ii) Float iii) String iv) Array v) Complex vi) Boolean vii) List viii) Tuple ix) Dictionary x) sets

Numbers
a=5 
b=10.3
c=5+3j
g="I'm a bad guy"
h=True
i=False
to know the data type of these variable above use command type(variable_name)
type(a) ---> int
type(b)---> float
type(c)---> complex
type(g)----> Str
type(h)----> bool
type(i)----> bool

LISTS
Use these brackets[] for list
there is no limitation on data type a list can hold or store int,str or boolean and sets.
no forced type casting that happens.
Lists are mutable
example--> mylist=[10,10.3,'shivam',True]
multiple data of different data type

You can access the list or element of list using INDEXING
example---> 
mylist=[10,10.3,'shivam',True]

print(mylist[2])
o/p 'shivam'

How? here it is
mylist=[10,10.3,'shivam',True]
       [ 0,  1 ,   2     , 3 ]  # these are index values for mylist here at 0 we have 10 at index 1 we have 10.3 and so on.

Q=How to assign the value inside a list?
A=mylist[2]=9999
when you will print mylist you will see output as below
[10, 10.3, 9999, True]

Q how can we append the list?
A use mylist.append(1000) it will append the your list here i'm appending mylist
o/p  [10, 10.3, 9999, True, 1000]

Q So when do we use lists?
A i) multiple data type need to be stored.
ii) when the values can be changed. (by indexing you can change values shown above)
iii) when there is a pre-known order among the values.

Q how iteration works using lists?
A Iteration happens using the index of the lists.

there are many methods you can use you can try yourself rest use mylist.(press tab) to check the options available.

Q how can i add multiple elements in a list?
A mylist.extend([22,22,23,45]) #use extend method here.
o/p [10, 10.3, 9999, True, 1000, 22, 22, 23, 45]

Q how can i insert element in specific position?
A mylist.insert(0,'shivam') 
o/p ['shivam', 10, 10.3, 9999, True, 1000, 22, 22, 23, 45]

Q how many elements are there in alist or what is the length of the list?
A print(len(mylist))

Q how can i remove element?
A to remove last element use POP.
mylist.pop()
when you will print mylist again then o/p will be below
['shivam', 10, 10.3, 9999, True, 1000, 22, 22, 23] # 45 is removed now

You can remove the element like below
1) mylist.remove('shivam')
o/p
[10, 10.3, 9999, True, 1000, 22, 22, 23] # shivam is removed.

Q how can i remove specific index element from list?
A mylist.remove(mylist[3]) #can be used 

Q how can i clear the list?
A mylist.clear()

you can use delete also. 
del(mylist[3])

DICTIONARY 

use these brackets for Dictionary{}
Dictionary is key value pair.
mostly used for look up.
mydict={'Rahul':98,'Rajeev':55,'Shivam':30} #these can be score of the student in a particular subject.
       {key:value , key:value, key: value}
Q what is the marks scored by shivam?
A mydict['Shivam']
o/p 30
You can try different methods for dictionary self.

TUPLE
Most used when you don't want your values to be changed.
Immutable data type
values cannot change
mytuple=(0.06,0.08,0.03) #these values cannot be changed.
you can access the element same as in case of list
no-reassigning can be done.
no append and no delete option.
You can convert list to tuple and vise-versa.

SETS
identified by {} # there is no key-value pair here.

Used to store unique value.
mylist=[10,10,2,4,12,4,2]
myset=set(mylist)
print(myset)
o/p
{10,2,4,12}
contains only unique values as above.
Q if you want to find the unique values between two lists.
A set(mylist).intersection(set(mylist1))
used to find out subset,union two sets are disjoints.

####
Slicing 
mylist[2:6]
starts from index 2 and goes till index 5
mylist[2:] from index 2 till end 
mylist[:6] from starting to fifth index.
mylist[1:6:2] starting from 1st position till 5th position with step size of 2.
